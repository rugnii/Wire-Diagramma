Features of the nike repair database tool

Glossary:
    Entry:
        Single dataset in a collection. Eg. one specific shoe model with data like name, description, year, key image, flaws etc.
    Collection: 
        A category for entries. Eg. the shoe-models collection would hold all entries that are shoe models
    Database:
        Stores several collections and manages the data (eg. adding/updating data)
General
    - User management to protect it from being public
    - Optional: users with different edit rights

Keyword search:
    - searches through all data stored in the database
    - get a list of results including key information
    - each result entry leads to a dedicated page
    - Filter for collections (eg. only search in images)

Entry page (Dedicated page for each entry)
    - view and edit data on the same page (eg. double-click on an value to change it)
    - pages for each collection can be designed individually
    - links leed directly to other pages
    - shortcuts for adding new entries in other collections while modifying an entry. (Eg. while uploading a new image to the af1 page, an entry in the image collection is generated as well)
    - Posibility to add new values over the course of the project
    - optional: Update changes automatically
    - optional: hidden attributes, eg. notes only visibly to pch

Repair action finder
    - select shoe type and flaws
     -> get a list of repair actions in an order that makes sense, including key info about the repair (time, tools, station)
    - optional: a map of stations that will be used and in which order

Syncplicity connectivity
    - something to look into a bit later in the process, because not super straight forward (data sequrity)
    - The idea would be to be able to select images that are in a specific syncplicity folder and add them to an entry

Open for new functions on the go
    - this could develope into an app for selecting certain customizations, generate patterns for the repair...
